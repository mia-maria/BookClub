# Project idea

This is a simple console application for a made up Book Club. It is intended to be used by the members of the book club. The goal is to provide useful facts about the books for the members. Another goal is to make it easy for the members to organise discussions about books online, by providing information about which members that have read a certain book.

The application provides an overview about all the books and all the authors in the database. It also provides information about which books a specific author has written. The application enables for the members to get a list with information about all the books that have been read and graded by different members. It is possible to search for books that belong to a certain genre. A member can also get information about the average grades that the books have recieved. The application further provides information about the average grade for an author based on the grades of her or his books. Finally, the application enables for the user to get information about which members that have read a certain book.

I generated the data by making up names of the members and creating details about which books they have read and graded. I used wellknown authors and book titles as material to the database. I used the site fejk.se to generate social security numbers to the members.
